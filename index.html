					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>My name is Kaiwen Su and I am a senior at UCSC. I am majoring in game design where I want to get to know with the coding part in this industry! 
						I was born in Shenzhen, China, a southern city right next to Hongkong.  In my spare time, I would play video games which you can tell from my major. However, I am also a soccer player and trombone player. 
						I was part of the brass band in my High School career and participated in several significant parades in downtown San Francisco.
