					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This is my first coding class related to art design and web design. 
						My knowledge of doing an HTML file had been forgotten, and it took me a while to remember how to structure the codes and the shortcut scripts. 
						One of the main challenges is to align the structure, such as the body or div, which avoids any mistakes.
					</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One of the problems is linking a file. I linked to a local file that I need to put in the GitHub folder to enable its display.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I learned the skeleton structure of a HTML and the correct way to fulfill my css file. The coloring and the boarder of textarea.</p>
